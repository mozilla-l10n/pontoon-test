<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE This file contains the browser main menu items -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE Do not translate commandkeys --> 

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.title): DONT_TRANSLATE -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlemodifier) : DONT_TRANSLATE -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlemodifiermenuseparator): DONT_TRANSLATE -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (mainWindow.titlePrivateBrowsingSuffix): This will be appended to the window's title
                                                                inside the private browsing mode -->

<!-- Tab context menu -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (closeTabsToTheEnd.label): This should indicate the
direction in which tabs are closed, i.e. locales that use RTL mode should say
left instead of right. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pinTab.label, unpinTab.label): "Pin" is being
used as a metaphor for expressing the fact that these tabs are "pinned" to the
left edge of the tabstrip. Really we just want the string to express the idea
that this is a lightweight and reversible action that keeps your tab where you
can reach it easily. -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (openLocationCmd.label): "Open Location" is only
displayed on OS X, and only on windows that aren't main browser windows, or
when there are no windows but Firefox is still running. -->




<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (enterFullScreenCmd.label, exitFullScreenCmd.label):
These should match what Safari and other Apple applications use on OS X Lion. -->




<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (fullscreenWarning.beforeDomain.label,
     fullscreenWarning.afterDomain.label): these two strings are used
     respectively before and after the domain requiring fullscreen.
     Localizers can use one of them, or both, to better adapt this
     sentence to their language. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (exitDOMFullscreen.button,
     exitDOMFullscreenMac.button): the "escape" button on PC keyboards
     is uppercase, while on Mac keyboards it is lowercase -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pointerlockWarning.beforeDomain.label,
     pointerlockWarning.afterDomain.label): these two strings are used
     respectively before and after the domain requiring pointerlock.
     Localizers can use one of them, or both, to better adapt this
     sentence to their language. -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (findShareServices.label):
  -  Use the unicode ellipsis char, \u2026,
  -  or use "..." if \u2026 doesn't suit traditions in your locale. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (shareLink.accesskey): must be different than the following share access keys -->










<!-- Toolbar items --> 




<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (bookmarksSidebarGtkCmd.commandkey): This command
  -  key should not contain the letters A-F, since these are reserved
  -  shortcut keys on Linux. -->


 





 

 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 



 
 
 
 
 

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (historyUndoWindowMenu): see bug 394759 -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (appMenuRemoteTabs.notabs.label): This is shown beneath
     the name of a device when that device has no open tabs -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (appMenuRemoteTabs.tabsnotsyncing.label): This is shown
     when Sync is configured but syncing tabs is disabled. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (appMenuRemoteTabs.noclients.label): This is shown
     when Sync is configured but this appears to be the only device attached to
     the account. We also show links to download Firefox for android/ios. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.moveToPanel.accesskey) can appear on the
     same context menu as menubarCmd and personalbarCmd, so they should have
     different access keys. customizeMenu.moveToToolbar and 
     customizeMenu.moveToPanel are mutually exclusive, so can share access
     keys.  -->



<!-- 
  Comment duplicated from browser-sets.inc:

  Search Command Key Logic works like this:

  Unix: Ctrl+J (0.8, 0.9 support)
        Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
  Mac:  Cmd+K (cross platform binding)
        Cmd+Opt+F (platform convention)
  Win:  Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
        Ctrl+E (IE compat)

  We support Ctrl+K on all platforms now and advertise it in the menu since it is
  our standard - it is a "safe" choice since it is near no harmful keys like "W" as
  "E" is. People mourning the loss of Ctrl+K for emacs compat can switch their GTK
  system setting to use emacs emulation, and we should respect it. Focus-Search-Box
  is a fundamental keybinding and we are maintaining a XP binding so that it is easy
  for people to switch to Linux.

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (contentSearchInput.label):
     This is set as the aria-label attribute for the search input box in the
     in-content search UI, to be used by screen readers. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchFor.label, searchWith.label):
     These two strings are used to build the header above the list of one-click
     search providers:  "Search for <used typed keywords> with:" -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (search.label, searchAfter.label):
     This string is used to build the header above the list of one-click search
     providers when a one off engine has been selected.  The searchAfter text is
     intentionally left empty for en-US and can be used by other localizations to
     display a string after the search engine name.  This string will be displayed
     as:  "Search <selected engine name><searchAfter.label text>" -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchWithHeader.label):
     The wording of this string should be as close as possible to
     searchFor.label and searchWith.label. This string will be used instead of
     them when the user has not typed any keyword. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (changeSearchSettings.button):
     This string won't wrap, so if the translated string is longer,
     consider translating it as if it said only "Search Settings". -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (viewPartialSourceCmd.accesskey): This accesskey is used for both 
         viewPartialSourceForSelectionCmd.label and viewPartialSourceForMathMLCmd.label -->
<!-- alternate for content area context menu -->
 

<!-- Media (video/audio) controls -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Play" and
"Pause" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Mute" and
"Unmute" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: "Ludicrous" is a reference to the
movie "Space Balls" and is meant to say that this speed is very
fast. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Show Controls" and
"Hide Controls" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Show Statistics" and
"Hide Statistics" are the same because the two context-menu
items are mutually exclusive. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE :
fullZoomEnlargeCmd.commandkey3, fullZoomReduceCmd.commandkey2 and
fullZoomResetCmd.commandkey2 are alternative acceleration keys for zoom.
If shift key is needed with your locale popular keyboard for them,
you can use these alternative items. Otherwise, their values should be empty.  -->

 <!-- + is above this key on many keyboards -->





 
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE(quitApplicationCmdUnix.key): This keyboard shortcut is used by both Linux and OSX builds. -->

  
  




<!-- On Windows we use the term "Options" to describe settings, but
     on Linux and Mac OS X we use "Preferences" - carry that distinction
     over into this string, which is used in the "popup blocked" info bar . -->






<!-- Strings for connection state warnings. -->

<!-- Strings for connection state warnings in the subview. -->





<!-- Name for the tabs toolbar as spoken by screen readers.
     The word "toolbar" is appended automatically and should not be contained below! -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (syncTabsMenu3.label): This appears in the history menu -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (syncedTabs.sidebar.tabsnotsyncing.label): This is shown
     when Sync is configured but syncing tabs is disabled. -->









<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (trackingProtection.unblock.label, trackingProtection.unblock.accesskey):
     The associated button with this label and accesskey is only shown when opening the control
     center while looking at a site with trackers in NON-private browsing mode. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (trackingProtection.unblockPrivate.label, trackingProtection.unblockPrivate.accesskey):
     The associated button with this label and accesskey is only shown when opening the control
     center while looking at a site with trackers in PRIVATE browsing mode. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pluginActivateNow.label, pluginActivateAlways.label, pluginBlockNow.label): These should be the same as the matching strings in browser.properties -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (pluginNotification.width): This is used to determine the
     width of the plugin popup notification that can appear if a plugin has been
     blocked on a page. Should be wide enough to fit the pluginActivateNow.label
     and pluginActivateAlways.label strings above on a single line. This must be
     a CSS length value. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (panicButton.view.mainTimeframeDesc, panicButton.view.5min, panicButton.view.2hr, panicButton.view.day):
     The .mainTimeframeDesc string combined with any of the 3 others is meant to form a complete sentence, e.g. "Forget the last: Five minutes".
     Please ensure that this remains the case in the translation. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (panicButton.view.mainLabel, panicButton.view.deleteCookies, panicButton.view.deleteHistory, panicButton.view.deleteTabsAndWindows, panicButton.view.openNewWindow):
     The .mainActionDesc string combined with any of the 4 others is meant to form a complete sentence, e.g. "Proceeding will: Delete Recent Cookies".
     Note also that the deleteCookies, deleteHistory and deleteTabsAndWindows strings include <html:strong> tags for emphasis on the words "Cookies", "History", "Tabs" and "Windows".
     The translation should do the same. -->
